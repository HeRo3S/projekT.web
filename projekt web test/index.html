                            <p>
                                The 58th year of Shouwa, early summer. <br>
                                It’s June, and the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years.
                                By day there are crickets, and by night there are cicadas.
                                We’re in Hinamizawa, a small village in the countryside.
                                There are fewer than two thousand people here. <br> But every year, there is an event. <br>
                                This event is a mysterious death. <br>
                                (The series has run from 1979 to 1983)

                        <p>
                            On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing.<br>
                            The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project.<br>
                            A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted.<br>
                            Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?<br>
                            Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t.<br>
                            Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.<br>
                            Someone who was alive last night is dead now.<br>
                            And someone who is here right now isn’t alive.<br>
                            So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up.<br>
                            But don’t give up.<br>
                            Only you can stand up to this.

                        The protagonist of the story. <br>
                        Though he is impatient and passionate, he is also indecisive. A character who seems to be stuck as the protagonist of a romance novel who is very shy towards girls. <br>

                        I promise that he is not obedient. <br>
                        I promise that he will be popular for some reason. <br>

                        However, unfortunately this story is not a romance novel, so his character will surely be a disaster. <br>
