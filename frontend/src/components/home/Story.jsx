          <p>
            On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes
            missing.
            <br />
            The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the
            dam construction project.
            <br />
            A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted.
            <br />
            Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?
            <br />
            Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t.
            <br />
            Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.
            <br />
            Someone who was alive last night is dead now.
            <br />
            And someone who is here right now isn’t alive.
            <br />
            So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give
            up.
            <br />
            But don’t give up.
            <br />
            Only you can stand up to this.
